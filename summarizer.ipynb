      "{'text': 'The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\\n\\n\\nSECTION 1.\\nThe Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\\n(a) (1) Since 1899 congressionally chartered veterans’ organizations have provided a valuable service to our nation’s returning service members. These organizations help preserve the memories and incidents of the great hostilities fought by our nation, and preserve and strengthen comradeship among members.\\n(2) These veterans’ organizations also own and manage various properties including lodges, posts, and fraternal halls. These properties act as a safe haven where veterans of all ages and their families can gather together to find camaraderie and fellowship, share stories, and seek support from people who understand their unique experiences. This aids in the healing process for these returning veterans, and ensures their health and happiness.\\n(b) As a result of congressional chartering of these veterans’ organizations, the United States Internal Revenue Service created a special tax exemption for these organizations under Section 501(c)(19) of the Internal Revenue Code.\\n(c) Section 501(c)(19) of the Internal Revenue Code and related federal regulations provide for the exemption for posts or organizations of war veterans, or an auxiliary unit or society of, or a trust or foundation for, any such post or organization that, among other attributes, carries on programs to perpetuate the memory of deceased veterans and members of the Armed Forces and to comfort their survivors, conducts programs for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes, sponsors or participates in activities of a patriotic nature, and provides social and recreational activities for their members.\\n(d) Section 215.1 of the Revenue and Taxation Code stipulates that all buildings, support and so much of the real property on which the buildings are situated as may be required for the convenient use and occupation of the buildings, used exclusively for charitable purposes, owned by a veterans’ organization that has been chartered by the Congress of the United States, organized and operated for charitable purposes, when the same are used solely and exclusively for the purpose of the organization, if not conducted for profit and no part of the net earnings of which ensures to the benefit of any private individual or member thereof, are exempt from taxation.\\n(e) The Chief Counsel of the State Board of Equalization concluded, based on a 1979 appellate court decision, that only parts of American Legion halls are exempt from property taxation and that other parts, such as billiard rooms, card rooms, and similar areas, are not exempt.\\n(f) In a 1994 memorandum, the State Board of Equalization’s legal division further concluded that the areas normally considered eligible for exemptions are the office areas used to counsel veterans and the area used to store veterans’ records, but that the meeting hall and bar found in most of the facilities are not considered used for charitable purposes.\\n(g) Tax-exempt status is intended to provide economic incentive and support to veterans’ organizations to provide for the social welfare of the community of current and former military personnel.\\n(h) The State Board of Equalization’s constriction of the tax exemption has resulted in an onerous tax burden on California veteran service organizations posts or halls, hinders the posts’ ability to provide facilities for veterans, and threatens the economic viability of many local organizations.\\n(i) The charitable activities of a veteran service organizations post or hall are much more than the counseling of veterans. The requirements listed for qualification for the federal tax exemption clearly dictate a need for more than just an office.\\n(j) Programs to perpetuate the memory of deceased veterans and members of the Armed Forces and to comfort their survivors require the use of facilities for funerals and receptions.\\n(k) Programs for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes require space for more than 50 attendees.\\n(l) Activities of a patriotic nature need facilities to accommodate hundreds of people.\\n(m) Social and recreational activities for members require precisely those areas considered “not used for charitable purposes” by the State Board of Equalization.\\n(n) The State Board of Equalization’s interpretation of the Revenue and Taxation Code reflects a lack of understanding of the purpose and programs of the veterans service organizations posts or halls and is detrimental to the good works performed in support of our veteran community.\\nSECTION 1.\\nSEC. 2.\\nSection 215.1 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to read:\\n215.1.\\n(a) All buildings, and so much of the real property on which the buildings are situated as may be required for the convenient use and occupation of the buildings, used exclusively for charitable purposes, owned by a veterans’ organization that has been chartered by the Congress of the United States, organized and operated for charitable purposes, and exempt from federal income tax as an organization described in Section 501(c)(19) of the Internal Revenue Code when the same are used solely and exclusively for the purpose of the organization, if not conducted for profit and no part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of any private individual or member thereof, shall be exempt from taxation.\\n(b) The exemption provided for in this section shall apply to the property of all organizations meeting the requirements of this section, subdivision (b) of Section 4 of Article XIII of the California Constitution, and paragraphs (1) to (4), inclusive, (6), and (7) of subdivision (a) of Section 214.\\n(c) (1) The exemption specified by subdivision (a) shall not be denied to a property on the basis that the property is used for fraternal, lodge, or social club purposes.\\n(2) With regard to this subdivision, the Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\\n(A) The exempt activities of a veterans’ organization as described in subdivision (a) qualitatively differ from the exempt activities of other nonprofit entities that use property for fraternal, lodge, or social club purposes in that the exempt purpose of the veterans’ organization is to conduct programs to perpetuate the memory of deceased veterans and members of the Armed Forces and to comfort their survivors, to conduct programs for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes, to sponsor or participate in activities of a patriotic nature, and to provide social and recreational activities for their members.\\n(B) In light of this distinction, the use of real property by a veterans’ organization as described in subdivision (a), for fraternal, lodge, or social club purposes is central to that organization’s exempt purposes and activities.\\n(C) In light of the factors set forth in subparagraphs (A) and (B), the use of real property by a veterans’ organization as described in subdivision (a) for fraternal, lodge, or social club purposes, constitutes the exclusive use of that property for a charitable purpose within the meaning of subdivision (b) of Section 4 of Article XIII of the California Constitution.\\n(d) The exemption provided for in this section shall not apply to any portion of a property that consists of a bar where alcoholic beverages are served. The portion of the property ineligible for the veterans’ organization exemption shall be that area used primarily to prepare and serve alcoholic beverages.\\n(e) An organization that files a claim for the exemption provided for in this section shall file with the assessor a valid organizational clearance certificate issued pursuant to Section 254.6.\\n(f) This exemption shall be known as the “veterans’ organization exemption.”\\nSEC. 2.\\nSEC. 3.\\nNotwithstanding Section 2229 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, no appropriation is made by this act and the state shall not reimburse any local agency for any property tax revenues lost by it pursuant to this act.\\nSEC. 3.\\nSEC. 4.\\nThis act provides for a tax levy within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect.', 'summary': 'Existing property tax law establishes a veterans’ organization exemption under which property is exempt from taxation if, among other things, that property is used exclusively for charitable purposes and is owned by a veterans’ organization.\\nThis bill would provide that the veterans’ organization exemption shall not be denied to a property on the basis that the property is used for fraternal, lodge, or social club purposes, and would make specific findings and declarations in that regard. The bill would also provide that the exemption shall not apply to any portion of a property that consists of a bar where alcoholic beverages are served.\\nSection 2229 of the Revenue and Taxation Code requires the Legislature to reimburse local agencies annually for certain property tax revenues lost as a result of any exemption or classification of property for purposes of ad valorem property taxation.\\nThis bill would provide that, notwithstanding Section 2229 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, no appropriation is made and the state shall not reimburse local agencies for property tax revenues lost by them pursuant to the bill.\\nThis bill would take effect immediately as a tax levy.', 'title': 'An act to amend Section 215.1 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, relating to taxation, to take effect immediately, tax levy.'}\n",
      "{'text': 'The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\\n\\n\\nSECTION 1.\\nThe Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\\n(a) The Legislature has previously provided funding for replacement of polluting and aged schoolbuses in small and disadvantaged communities.\\n(b) Schoolbus replacement programs currently exist in the Bay Area and the Los Angeles Basin. For example, the Lower-Emission School Bus Program is a partnership between the State Air Resources Board and air districts, and is administered by the Bay Area Air Quality Management District in the Bay Area. The goals of that program are to reduce the exposure of schoolchildren to harmful emissions of particulate matter, oxides of nitrogen, and nonmethane hydrocarbons, which contribute to summertime smog.\\n(c) Air districts currently evaluate qualified projects in disproportionately impacted communities, according to regional poverty level, particulate matter exposure, toxic exposure, and disproportionate impact mapping that works to promote schoolbus replacement in densely populated areas.\\n(d) It is also necessary to provide funding for schoolbus replacement in less populated areas with disadvantaged communities.\\nSEC. 2.\\nSection 39719.4 is added to the Health and Safety Code, to read:\\n39719.4.\\n(a) The Schoolbus Replacement for Small and Disadvantaged Communities Grant Program is hereby created, to be administered by the State Department of Education in conjunction with the state board. Commencing in the 2015–16 fiscal year, the sum of five million dollars ($5,000,000) annually is hereby appropriated from the fund to the department to fund the purchase of new schoolbuses to replace existing schoolbuses by applicants eligible under this section. Funds made available under the program shall be used to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the state in accordance with Section 39712.\\n(b) (1) A school district or county office of education with an average daily attendance of less than 2,501, with more than 50 percent of the pupil population qualifying for free or reduced-price lunch programs, shall be eligible to apply to the department for a grant under this section.\\n(2) A school district or county office of education meeting the requirements of paragraph (1) and providing pupil transportation services through a cooperative, consortium, or joint powers agreement, shall be an eligible applicant under the program.\\n(3) The Division of State Special Schools of the State Department of Education shall also be an eligible applicant under the program.\\n(c) The State Department of Education shall develop priority categories for funds available under this section based solely on vehicle age and accumulated mileage. An eligible applicant shall submit, as evidence of the condition of the vehicle to be replaced, the most recent inspection report of the Department of the California Highway Patrol, a repair estimate made by an independent repair shop, and any other information requested by the department.\\n(d) The State Department of Education shall estimate the cost of a replacement schoolbus of the same capacity as the schoolbus being replaced. Program funds made available to an applicant for a schoolbus may not exceed that estimated cost. However, an applicant may use other funds available to the applicant to purchase a schoolbus that is more expensive than the model used by the department to make its cost estimate.\\n(e) A schoolbus purchased with funds made available by this section shall meet the requirements of federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 222.\\n(f) (1) A schoolbus that has been disposed of is not eligible for replacement under the program.\\n(2) For an eligible applicant with fewer than three schoolbuses, a schoolbus shall be considered disposed of for the purposes of replacement if it is designated as a temporary schoolbus. A temporary schoolbus is a schoolbus that has annual mileage of no more than 10 percent of the total average annual mileage of all nontemporary schoolbuses of that applicant measured over the prior five years.\\n(3) After a schoolbus is designated as a temporary schoolbus, it may only be used as a schoolbus if it is in compliance with all applicable provisions of the Vehicle Code and associated regulations.\\n(g) Schoolbus purchases with funds made available under the program shall be made by the Department of General Services, to the extent practicable. The title to a schoolbus purchased by the Department of General Services shall be in the name of the applicant for which the schoolbus was purchased.\\n(h) Funds shall be made available for schoolbuses used in special education in a proportion to total funding not less than the proportion of special education schoolbuses to the total number of schoolbuses in the state, as determined by the State Department of Education. The department may adopt regulations to implement this section in an equitable manner.\\nSECTION 1.\\nSection 9552 of the\\nVehicle Code\\nis amended to read:\\n9552.\\n(a)When a vehicle is operated on a highway of this state without the fees first having been paid as required by this code, and those fees have not been paid within 30 days of its first operation, those fees are delinquent, except as provided in subdivision (b).\\n(b)Fees are delinquent when an application for renewal of registration, or an application for renewal of special license plates, is made after midnight of the expiration date of the registration or special plates, or 60 days after the date the registered owner is notified by the department pursuant to Section 1661, whichever is later.\\n(c)When a person has received as transferee a properly endorsed certificate of ownership and the transfer fee has not been paid as required by this code within 10 days, the fee is delinquent.\\n(d)When a person becomes an automobile dismantler, dealer, manufacturer, manufacturer branch, distributor, distributor branch, or transporter without first having paid the license and special plate fees as required by this code, the fees are delinquent.', 'summary': 'Existing law requires all moneys, except for fines and penalties, collected by the State Air Resources Board from the auction or sale of allowances as part of a market-based compliance mechanism relative to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, commonly known as cap and trade revenues, to be deposited in the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and to be used, upon appropriation by the Legislature, for specified purposes. Existing law provides various programs to fund the acquisition of schoolbuses.\\nThis bill would create the Schoolbus Replacement for Small and Disadvantaged Communities Grant Program, and would appropriate $5 million annually from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to the State Department of Education for the program. The program would be administered by the department in conjunction with the State Air Resources Board, and would provide schoolbus replacement grants to school districts or county offices of education with an average daily attendance of less than 2,501 and with more than 50% of the pupil population qualifying for free or reduced-rate lunch programs, and to certain other eligible applicants. The bill would impose various requirements in that regard. The bill would also make legislative findings and declarations.\\nUnder existing law, fees required by the Vehicle Code are delinquent when a vehicle is operated on a highway without those fees first having been paid and when those fees have not been paid within 20 days of the vehicle’s first operation, subject to specified exceptions.\\nThis bill would increase that amount of time to 30 days.', 'title': 'An act to amend Section 9552 of the Vehicle Code, relating to vehicles.\\nAn act to add Section 39719.4 to the Health and Safety Code, relating to greenhouse gases, and making an appropriation therefor.'}\n"
